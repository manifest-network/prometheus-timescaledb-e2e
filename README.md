# E2E Prometheus to TimescaleDB

This is a proof-of-concept project that demonstrates how to use TimescaleDB as a long-term storage solution for Prometheus metrics. The project includes a set of scripts and configurations to set up a complete end-to-end pipeline that collects, processes, and stores Prometheus metrics in TimescaleDB.
